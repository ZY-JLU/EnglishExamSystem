                "text": "A Message in a bottle sent out to sea by a New Hampshire man more than five decades ago was found 1,500 miles away and has been returned to his daughter. The long lost message was discovered by Clint Buffington of Utah while he was vacationing. Buffington says he found a soda bottle half buried in the sand that looked like it had been there since the beginning of time. The note inside the bottles said, “return to 419 Ocean Street and receive a reward of $150 from Richard and Tina Pierce, owners of the Beach comber motel.” The motel was owned by the parents of Paula Pierce in 1960. Her father had written the note as a joke and had thrown it into the Atlantic Ocean. Buffington flew to New Hampshire to deliver the message to Paula Pierce. She held up to her father’s promise giving Buffington that reward, but the biggest reward is the message in a bottle finding its way back home.",

A new study in mice may help to explain why hunger can feel like such a \npowerful motivating force. In the study, researchers found that hunger \noutweighed other physical drives including fear, thirst and social needs to \ndetermine which feeling won out. The researchers did a series of \nexperiments.\n\n\nIn one experiment, the mice were both hungry and thirsty. When given the \nchoice of either eating food or drinking water, the mice went for the food the \nresearchers found. However, when the mice were well-fed but thirsty they opted \nto drink according to the study.\n\n\nThe second experiment meant to pit the mice’s hunger against their fear. \nHungry mice were placed in a cage that had certain Fox centered areas and other \nplaces that smelled safer. In other words, not like an animal that could eat \nthem but also had food. It turned out that when the mice were hungry they \nventured into the unsafe areas for food. But when the mice were well-fed they \nstayed in areas of the cage that were considered safe. Hunger also outweighed \nthe mice’s social needs, the researchers found. Mice are usually social animals \nand prefer to be in the company of other mice according to the study. When the \nmice were hungry they opted to leave the company of other mice to go get \nfood.",

Did you ever wonder why such a complete system of excellent roads \nexists? For an answer, you would have to go back to the early 1920s. In those \nyears just after World War I, the military wanted to build an American highway \nsystem for national defense. Such a system could if necessary move troops \nquickly from one area to another. It could also get people out of cities in \ndanger of being bombed, so-called roads of national importance were designated, \nbut they were mostly small country roads. In 1944 Congress passed a bill to \nupgrade the system but did not fund the plan right away. In the 1950s, the plan \nbegan to become a reality. Over 25 billion dollars was appropriated by Congress \nand construction began on about 40,000 miles of new roads. The idea was to \nconnect the new system to existing expressways and freeways. And though the \nsystem was built mostly to make car travel easier, defense was not forgotten. \nFor instance, highway overpasses had to be high enough to allow trailers \ncarrying military missiles to pass under them. By 1974, this system was mostly \ncompleted a few additional roads would come later. Quick and easy travel between \nall parts of the country was now possible.",

                "text": "Texting while driving was listed as a major cause of road deaths among young \nAmericans back in 2013. A recent study said that 40 percent of American teens \nclaimed to have been in a car when the driver used a cell phone in a way that \nput people in danger. This sounds like a widespread disease but it’s one that \ntechnology may now help to cure. T.J. Evert, a 20-year-old inventor, has come up \nwith a novel solution that could easily put texting drivers on notice. It’s \ncalled Smart Wheel and it’s designed to fit over the steering wheel of most \nstandard vehicles to track whether or not the driver has two hands on the wheel \nat all times. Evert’s invention warns the drivers with a light and a sound when \nthey hold the wheel with one hand only. But as soon as they place the other hand \nback on the wheel the light turns back to green and the sound stops. It also \nwatches for what’s called “close by hands”where both hands are close together \nnear the top of the wheel, so the driver can type with both thumbs and drive at \nthe same time. All the data smart wheel collects is also sent to a connected \napp, so any parents who install smart wheel can keep track of the teen’s driving \nhabits. If they try to remove or damage the cover, that’s reported as well.",

            "text": "A) Digital learning systems now charge students for access codes needed to complete coursework, take quizzes, and turn in homework. As universities go digital, students are complaining of a new hit to their finances that s replacing―and sometimes joining―expensive textbooks: pricey online access codes that are required to complete coursework and submit assignments.B) The codes―which typically range in price from $ 80 to $ 155 per course―give students online access to systems developed by education companies like McGraw Hill and Pearson. These companies, which long reaped big profits as textbook publishers, have boasted that their new online offerings, when pushed to students through universities they partner with, represent the future of the industry.\nC) But critics say the digital access codes represent the same profit-seeking ethos (观念) of the textbook business, and are even harder for students to opt out of. While they could once buy second-hand textbooks, or share copies with friends, the digital systems are essentially impossible to avoid.\nD) \"When we talk about the access code we see it as the new face of the textbook monopoly (垄断), a new way to lock students around this system,\" said Ethan Senack, the higher education advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, to BuzzFeed News. \"Rather than $250 (for a print textbook) you re paying $ 120,\" said Senack. \"But because it s all digital it eliminates the used book market and eliminates any sharing and because homework and tests are through an access code, it eliminates any ability to opt out.\"\nE) Sarina Harpet, a 19-year-old student at Virginia Tech, was faced with a tough dilemma when she first started college in 2015―pay rent or pay to turn in her chemistry homework. She told BuzzFeed News that her freshman chemistry class required her to use Connect, a system provided by McGraw Hill where students can submit homework, take exams and track their grades. But the code to access the program cost $ 120―a big sum for Harper, who had already put down $ 450 for textbooks, and had rent day approaching.\nF) She decided to wait for her next work-study paycheck, which was typically $ 150- $ 200, to pay for the code. She knew that her chemistry grade may take a dive as a result. \"It s a balancing act,\" she said. \"Can I really afford these access codes now?\" She didn t hand in her first two assignments for chemistry, which started her out in the class with a failing grade.\nG) The access codes may be another financial headache for students, but for textbook businesses, they re the future. McGraw Hill, which controls 21% of the higher education market, reported in March that its digital content sales exceeded print sales for the first time in 2015. The company said that 45% of its $ 140 million revenue in 2015 \"was derived from digital products.\"\nH) A Pearson spokesperson told BuzzFeed News that \"digital materials are less expensive and a good investment\" that offer new features, like audio texts, personalized knowledge checks and expert videos. Its digital course materials save students up to 60% compared to traditional printed textbooks, the company added. McGraw Hill didn t respond to a request for comment, but its CEO David Levin told the Financial Times in August that \"in higher education, the era of the printed textbook is now over.\"\nI) The textbook industry insists the online systems represent a better deal for students. \"These digital products aren t just mechanisms for students to submit homework, they offer all kinds of features,\" David Anderson, the executive director of higher education with the Association of American Publishers, told BuzzFeed News. \"It helps students understand in a way that you can t do with print homework assignments.\"\nJ) David Hunt, an associate professor in sociology at Augusta University, which has rolled out digital textbooks across its math and psychology departments, told BuzzFeed News that he understands the utility of using systems that require access codes. But he doesn t require his students to buy access to a learning program that controls the class assignments. \"I try to make things as inexpensive as possible,\" said Hunt, who uses free digital textbooks for his classes but designs his own curriculum. \"The online systems may make my life a lot easier but I feel like I m giving up control. The discussions are the things where my expertise can benefit the students most.\"\nK) A 20-year-old junior at Georgia Southern University told BuzzFeed News that she normally spends $ 500-$ 600 on access codes for class. In one case, the professor didn t require students to buy a textbook, just an access code to turn in homework. This year she said she spent $ 900 on access codes to books and programs. \"That s two months of rent,\" she said. \"You can t sell any of it back. With a traditional textbook you can sell it for $ 30 - $ 50 and that helps to pay for your new semester s books. With an access code, you re out of that money. \"\nL) Benjamin Wolverton, a 19-year-old student at the University of South Carolina, told BuzzFeed News that \"it s ridiculous that after paying tens of thousands in tuition we have to pay for all these access codes to do our homework.\" Many of the access codes he s purchased have been required simply to complete homework or quizzes. \"Often it s only 10% of your grade in class.\" he said. \"You re paying so much money for something that hardly affects your grade―but if you didn t have it, it would affect your grades enough. It would be bad to start out at a B or C.\" Wolverton said he spent $ 500 on access codes for digital books and programs this semester.\nM) Harper, a poultry (家禽) science major, is taking chemistry again this year and had to buy a new access code to hand in her homework. She rented her economics and statistics textbooks for about $ 20 each. But her access codes for homework, which can t be rented or bought second-hand, were her most expensive purchases: $ 120 and $ 85.\nN) She still remembers the sting of her first experience skipping an assignment due to the high prices. \"We don t really have a missed assignment policy,\" she said. \"If you miss it, you just miss it. I just got zeros on a couple of first assignments. I managed to pull everything back up. But as a scared freshman looking at their grades, it s not fun.\"",

                "text": "Losing your ability to think and remember is pretty scary. We know the risk of dementia (痴呆症) increases with age. But if you have memory slips, you probably needn t worry. There are pretty clear differences between signs of dementia and age-related memory loss.After age 50, it s quite common to have trouble remembering the names of people, places and things quickly, says Dr. Kirk Daffner of Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston.\nThe brain ages just like the rest of the body. Certain parts shrink, especially areas in the brain that are important to learning, memory and planning. Changes in brain cells can affect communication between different regions of the brain. And blood flow can be reduced as blood vessels narrow.\nForgetting the name of an actor in a favorite movie, for example, is nothing to worry about. But if you forget the plot of the movie or don t remember even seeing it, that s far more concerning, Daffner says.\nWhen you forget entire experiences, he says, that s \"a red flag that something more serious may be involved.\" Forgetting how to operate a familiar object like a microwave oven, or forgetting how to drive to the house of a friend you ve visited many times before can also be signs of something going wrong.\nBut even then, Daffner says, people shouldn t panic. There are many things that can cause confusion and memory loss, including health problems like temporary stoppage of breathing during sleep, high blood pressure, or depression, as well as medications (药物) like antidepressants.\nYou don t have to figure this out on your own. Daffner suggests going to your doctor to check on medications, health problems and other issues that could be affecting memory. And the best defense against memory loss is to try to prevent it by building up your brain s cognitive (认知的) reserve, Daffner says.\n\"Read books, go to movies, take on new hobbies or activities that force one to think in novel ways,\" he says. In other words, keep your brain busy and working. And also get physically active, because exercise is a known brain booster.",

                "text": "A letter written by Charles Darwin in 1875 has been returned to the Smithsonian \nInstitution Archives (档案馆) by the FBI after being stolen twice.\n\"We realized \nin the mid-1970s that it was missing,\" says Effie Kapsalis, head of the \nSmithsonian Insitution Archives. \"It was noted as missing and likely taken by an \nintern (实习生), from what the FBI is telling us. Word got out that it was missing \nwhen someone asked to see the letter for research purposes,\" and the intern put \nthe letter back. \"The intern likely took the letter again once nobody was \nwatching it.\"\nDecades passed. Finally, the FBI received a tip that the stolen \ndocument was located very close to Washington, D.C. Their art crime team \nrecovered the letter but were unable to press charges because the time of \nlimitations had ended. The FBI worked closely with the Archives to determine \nthat the letter was both authentic and definitely Smithsonian s property.\nThe \nletter was written by Darwin to thank an American geologist, Dr. Ferdinand \nVandeveer Hayden, for sending him copies of his research into the geology of the \nregion that would become Yellowstone National Park.\nThe letter is in fairly \ngood condition, in spite of being out of the care of trained museum staff for so \nlong. \"It was luckily in good shape,\" says Kapsalis, \"and we just have to do \nsome minor things in order to be able to unfold it. It has some glue on it that \nhas colored it slightly, but nothing that will prevent us from using it. After \nit is repaired, we will take digital photos of it and that will be available \nonline. One of our goals is to get items of high research value or interest to \nthe public online.\"\nIt would now be difficult for an intern, visitor or a \nthief to steal a document like this. \"Archiving practices have changed greatly \nsince the 1970s,\" says Kapsalis, \"and we keep our high value documents in a safe \nthat I don t even have access to.\"",
